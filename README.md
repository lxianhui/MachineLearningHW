This is a collection of machine learning homeworks from Cornell Tech.

Contents include:

Digit Recognizer: Use self-implemented KNN classifier to predict which number the pixels represent.
Titanic: Use logistic regression to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster.
Sentiment Analysis: Determine the attitudes of reviews from Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB. Implement Bag of Words model and n-gram model. Compare the performance of Naive Bayes and Logistic regression for each model.
House Prices: Predict the house price based on 80+ features. Compare models of OLS, KNN, Ridge, LASSO, forward and backward stepwise regression, and determine the best model to be used.
